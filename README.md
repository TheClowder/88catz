# 88catz


This is an experiment that will run for 88 days where catz *cough* sorry--where humans will code 88 ideas with go and elixir. 

## Rules

There are only two rules:

- It has to be done one per day.
- Katas should be on Go or Elixir

It will start on a prime day which will be Aug 17th, 2017 to end on another prime day Nov 13th, 2017.

To keep it simple the repertoire will be katas from Code Wars of level 6-8

## How do I register?

Anyone is freely and welcome to participate! To register you just have to do the following:

1. Clone this repository on your machine and then cd into the folder. All your code should be inside this folder

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:TheClowder/88catz.git
$ cd 88catz
```

2. Create a folder with your Github username. 

```bash
$ mkdir mayra-cabrera
```

Don't forget to add an empty file called `.gitkeep` in the directory, otherwise it will be automatically ignored by git.

3. Make a pull request to `master` and that's it!

## How do I participate?

To submit code, just follow this steps:


1. As stated above only katas from Code Wars of level 6 to 8 will be taken into account, so please make sure your kata is on these levels before submitting.

2. In your folder create a file with a name that satisfies the following convention:

```
<date>-<name-of-kata>
```

Example

```
17-august-multiplies-3-of-5.go
```

3. Inside the file add a link to the kata you're solving

```go
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-and-5

// Your code here 
```

4. Make a pull request against `master`, and that's it! 

At the end of the game, November 13th, you should have 88 files in your folder! :tada:
